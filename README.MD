<h2 align="center" style="font-weight:bold">Project Description</h2>

With the emergence of new techniques of machine learning, and the possibility of using algorithms to perform tasks previously done by human beings, as well as to generate new knowledge, we again face a set of new ethical questions. These questions not only concern the possibility of harm by the misuse of data but also questions of how to preserve privacy where data is sensitive, how to avoid bias in data selection, how to prevent disruption and **hacking** of data, and issues of **transparency in data collection, research, and dissemination**.

<h2 align="center" style="font-weight:bold" id="features">Platform Features</h2>

- **Core Feature** Protection of raw data to maintain privacy and prevent disruption and hacking of the same by anonymizing the sensitive information. On doing so, the data is now private enough to be processed for unstructured information management and analysis.
