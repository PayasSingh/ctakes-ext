He reports this started several years ago and has progressed over the past year to include his foot. His ability to walk has worsened and he cannot even walk half of a block due to pain. He also reports several years of spontaneous ulcers on his shins and now a new ulcer to his right 2nd toe over the past 3 weeks. The patient denies any trauma or skin opening to that area. The patient was seen by a podiatrist called Dr. Myron who started him on Augmentin and a topical antifungal over 1 week ago.")
